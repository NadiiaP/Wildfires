# Wildfires
Exploring Northern California’s Air quality based on Daily PM2.5, O3, and CO Concentrations (1980 - 2022).

## Goal: 
Predict Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration in counties in California for preventing wildfires in future.

## Objectives:
### Data Scope and Focus:
Focus the analysis on Northern California to provide localized and actionable predictions for the region.
### Temporal Analysis:
Analyze the dataset's time range, spanning from 1980 to 2022, to identify temporal trends and patterns.
### Machine Learning Implementation:
Implement machine learning techniques, leveraging libraries like scikit-learn (sklearn), to build predictive models for PM2.5 concentration.
### Model Validation:
Validate the accuracy and reliability of predictive models using techniques like cross-validation.
Calculate appropriate evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
### Future Value Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict future daily mean PM2.5 concentrations in Northern California.
Provide insights into the expected air quality changes over time.

## Dataset:
Covers multiple pollutants (CO, Ozone, PM2.5).
Spans the time range from 1980 to 2022.

Wildfires produce a range of harmful air pollutants, from cancer-causing substances to tiny particles that can aggravate existing health problems and increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. Particulate matter (PM) is the main pollutant of concern from wildfire smoke for   relatively short-term exposures (hours to weeks). Particles from smoke can be very small (with diameters of 2.5 micrometers and smaller). They are small enough to get deep into the lungs and the tiniest, ultrafine particles can pass directly into the bloodstream. The association between PM2.5 and heart and lung health effects is well documented in scientific literature.
Larger, more frequent and intense wildfires are a growing public health problem, contributing to reduced air quality for people living near or downwind of fire. Smoke can travel hundreds of miles, so you can be impacted even if you’re not near an active fire. Health problems related to wildfire smoke exposure can be as mild as eye and respiratory tract irritation and as serious as worsening of heart and lung disease, including asthma, and even premature death.
